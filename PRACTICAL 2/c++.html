    <h1><u>C++</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language that builds on the foundations of the C programming language. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the early 1980s and officially standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1998. C++ is known for combining low-level programming features from C with high-level object-oriented programming (OOP) features. </p>
