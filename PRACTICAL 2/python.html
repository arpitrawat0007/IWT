    <h1><u>Python</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language that emphasizes readability and ease of use. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has since become one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. Its design philosophy focuses on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than languages like C++ or Java. </p>
