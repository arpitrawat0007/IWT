    <h1><u>Java</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Java is a versatile, object-oriented, and high-performance programming language that was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s. One of Java's key features is its platform independence, achieved through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows Java applications to run on any device or operating system that has a compatible JVM implementation. </p>
